# bubble-sort

This is the one of the Ruby projects from the Odin Project.

The bubble-sort methods takes an array of integers as the argument,
return the array after sorting the elements in ascending order.

The below is the example:
```Ruby
input = [4, 3, 2, 1]
p bubble-sort(input)
# => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This function returns `[]` if the input array is empty.
